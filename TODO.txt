Things still to be done, ideas for improvement:

- Set up DB connect string in config.pl.

- Bounce/forward the email if there's a problem. (Bounce if outgoing, forward
  to admin if incoming.)  Need a routine that can be called from anywhere in
  the program to do this.  Email::Sender::Simple looks good for this.

- Flag emails without a file number by bounce/forward as above.

- If we had to make up a file name, the extension is probably wrong. Check the
  mime type of the content and change the extension if required.  Useful perl
  modules might be File::Mimeinfo::Magic and MIME::Types.

- Add a database tidying routine to run, say, once per month, which will go
  through the database and delete entries for files which no longer exist.

- Add a database pre-seeding routing to traverse a filesystem, checksum all of
  the files, and add them to the database (including SpamAssassin training, if
  necessary).  It would need to use the file's timestamp as the add to
  database time - that way older files would be treated as older (not that
  this is really important).

- Need to think about how spam will be handled.  Ordinarily it will be handled
  as an incoming email without a file number, so will be bounced to the admin,
  which will result in spam doubling for the admin.  Perhaps we need to use
  the existing correspondence corpus to train a SpamAssassin bayes database in
  our base directory and discard those emails determined to be spam.  It
  shouldn't be hard to integrate the SpamAssassin libraries to do so.

- Create a complete test suite.

- Save statistics for emails:
	senders (domain & user)
	recipients (domain & user)
	project numbers
	size
	date

- Change debug/error to warn/die and provide signal handlers that reformat.
  Or just switch to log4perl.

- Optional feature to link all correspondence into a single directory with no
  duplication of files if an identical copy is already there.
