This is very sketchy at the moment.  More will be filled in here as the
project is filled out.

Notes on the overall design goals:

- Capture all mail relating to a project.

- Work as an email content mangler so that headers can be added and the
  message delivery can continue in the case of an error.

- Work exactly as the original client intended, but be flexible enough to
  adapt to other filing systems.
